Input : A sequence of n numbers (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7, .... xN).

Output : Reordering the input sequence (x1', x2', x3', x4', x5', x6', x7', .... xN')
         such that: x1' <= x2' <= x3'... <= xN'

Let's say,
    we have an input : (5, 1, 6, 3, 2)

    so a correct sorting algorithm will return an
    output sequence : (1, 2, 3, 5, 6)

# Such that the input sequence is called an [[INSTANCE]] of the sorting algorithm.
