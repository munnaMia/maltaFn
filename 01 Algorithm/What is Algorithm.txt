Algorithm: An algorithm is any well defined computational procedures that take some 
           values as inputs and produce some output or a set of outputs in a finit 
           amount of time.

# The input sequence is called an [[INSTANCE]] of the sorting algorithm.

# An algorithm can be specified in English, as a computer program, or as a hardware design. 
The only requirement is that the specification must provide a precise description of the 
computational procedure to be followed.
